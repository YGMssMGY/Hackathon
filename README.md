# Hackathon - Theme 1 simulation of Gravity and general relativity visualization(BASIC)
### By Harry Liu, Mcqueen Zhang, and KKCHEN
# This project aims to simulate and visualize the incredible nature of general relativity (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzQC3uYL67U), the project uses 3.js with the application of HTML, and the program is also implemented with Gravitational simulation. The dynamic spacetime distortion is simulated with the size of the sphere. The sphere size is adjustable and the distortion is responsive. I found that this is an interesting topic not only for students but also for many general viewers because it is an understandable visualization without complex contexts. Please feel free to play around. 

*** Note that the program does not reflect specific physics concepts. It is programmed in a way to visualize and understand easily, so do not take it seriously!***
